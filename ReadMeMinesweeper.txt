Game: Minesweeper
Specs: Basic Minesweeper supporting restart and flagging operations.
Motivation: I made this game over my winter break for fun. It is very bare bones, but I wanted
a project that would only take me a few hours for some quick Java practice before moving into some
more in-depth coding in JavaScript/React Native. It is a final project game for a class I used to be
a TA for at Penn, so I figured I'd give it a go and see what students typically have to do. I was
surprised as how simple this game was, especially in juxtaposition to the game I did for the class
by choice, which had far more lines of code.
